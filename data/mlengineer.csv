ABOUT VIDA 


What are we trying to solve? 
We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now. 
Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered. 
Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change. 
At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone. 


Why are we solving this problem? 
The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change. 


Who are we? 
We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns. 


Other things that we care about: 

Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. 
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village. 
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.

Current pet care providers are unable to provide quality care for our pets virtually. Or quickly. Or reliably.
 So, we’re building one.
 We're looking for Software Engineer Interns to join our growing team in Singapore. The role is a unique opportunity to build
 beautifully simple experiences that guide pet owners through their pet’s health and wellness journey.

 How You’ll Be Creating Change
 We believe pet care should be easy. Reliable, Effective, and Convenient. You’ll hide away all complexities under the hood of
 our product and build seamless experiences for our customers.
 Create clear and high-impact features, whilst maintaining consistency, maintainability, and performance. You’ll empower pet
 owners to make better and more informed decisions about their pet’s health and wellness at all stages of their lives - so our
 pets can live their lives to the fullest.

Software Engineer (All Levels)
 About the role

 This Role Will Allow You To

Do the right things, even if it’s different – We believe in putting the pet first when it comes to solutions. So rather

 than telling you what to do, you’ll work with your team to constantly think about how we can benefit the lives of our pets, even if it is different.

Own it and deliver it - Take the initiative to lead any projects that you have taken up. You will be provided with the autonomy to make it happen.
Be flexible in how and where you work - We understand everyone has their own personal commitments and state of flow.
Solve real problems - This is not a drill. Throughout your internship, your code will be pushed to production for the world wide web to see.

We own and develop the Dyson Link Smart home app, which is at the forefront of Dyson's IoT experience. We are proud of what we have built so far; we have an App Store and Google Play rating of 4.5 and 4.3 stars respectively, we have more than 1 million active users worldwide and our IoT platform has over 3 million connected Dyson machines. We have huge ambition to grow this platform and as we connect more machines from more categories the challenge is significant.


 Our team 
There are 5 app teams, located in the UK and Singapore, each with up to 6 mobile developers and 3 test automation engineers, plus a scrum master and product owner. We all come from a variety of educational backgrounds and experience levels; not all of us are computer science graduates. We believe that teams composed of people from diverse backgrounds are more successful and innovative.  Our teams have the autonomy to manage their own work using Scrum or Kanban frameworks, each honing their ways of working through regular retrospectives and knowledge sharing. We all share a commitment to creating high-quality code, and engineers choose to follow practices such as pair programming, mobbing, and test-driven development. We also regularly share our knowledge and interests peer-to-peer through ‘community meetings’, which have led to the adoption of new technologies and improved cross-team collaboration.  We often need to interact with people from different parts of the business, such as embedded software and the cloud teams, so we plan in 5-sprint ‘increments’, based on the best bits of the Scaled Agile Framework. This gives us more visibility of upcoming work while remaining responsive, and allows us to collaborate effectively with other teams within our 11,000-person organisation.  Mutual trust and respect between team members is important to build a supportive environment where people can do their best work. Our teams understand themselves well enough to make decisions about how they work; everyone’s contribution is vital.  Besides being software professionals, we are also people who enjoy playing online or board games, heading out to lunchtime yoga classes, recording our latest run on Strava or just catching up over coffee. The last year has been a challenge, but we have maintained and strengthened our culture while working through the various lockdowns with virtual events, an informal team newsletter and an empathetic attitude to the needs of individuals.


 Our tech 
Android: We write our unit tests with JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito, and our UI tests are written in Kotlin using the Espresso framework with Kakao.  iOS: Unit tests are written with XCTest and RxTest, and we write our automated UI tests in Swift using XCUITest.  We also have a handful of cross platform appium tests written in ruby, but we are migrating away from these in favour of XCUITest and Espresso.  Unit and UI tests are written as part of each story to ensure we maintain an up to date and comprehensive set of automated tests with no test debt. We complement our automated tests with exploratory testing, involving both developers and testers in order to uncover issues quickly.


 About the role
 We are on the lookout for Test Engineers to join our mobile app team at Dyson. Communication, collaboration, self-evaluation and a desire to improve are second nature to you, and you value good engineering practises. You understand the need to deliver robust, testable code balanced against the need to deliver fast.

 Working with your fellow engineers to contribute to features and improvements to our Dyson Link app, ensuring they are tested, robust and scalable
 Working with colleagues from other disciplines, including developers, product owners, Scrum Masters, UX/UI designers, and software engineers in our cloud and embedded teams
 Sharing knowledge within the app team to develop your skills and competencies and those of your teammates
 Identifying new technologies, tools and approaches to help continually improve standards and quality
 Writing UI automation tests
 Coordinating exploratory testing sessions
 Monitoring and prioritising bugs
 Keeping the scrum team focused on a quality first mindset



 About you

 You’re interested in how technology can improve the environments people live in
 You’re a collaborative person that believes in the Agile principles and how they can help empowered teams deliver the best software
 You’ve contributed quality UI test code to commercial projects
 You’re passionate about learning new things and sharing those things with others
 You embrace change and can be flexible in your approach to problems
 Adept at understanding and explaining complex logical and technical details in both written and spoken English

About Tookitaki 
Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include: 

We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditationat-sgd) 
We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx) 
We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/) 
We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/) 

In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs. 
Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to existing core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry. 
Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS. 


Role: Implementation Engineer 
The engineering team is responsible for building a robust predictive platform, which can add significant value to the BFSI vertical in solving operational and compliance risk problems. We take pride in building the system right and continuously evolving it. You have the freedom to choose right tools for the task. We encourage our engineers to participate in and contribute to open-source communities. 
Our Ideal Candidate 
Our engineering team is looking for a Implementation engineer with 3-6 years of solid experience. The candidate's responsibilities and required skills and experience are: 

Managing the big data application stack including HDFS, YARN, Spark, Hive and Hbase 
Deeper understanding of all the configurations required for installing and maintaining the infrastructure in the long run 
Experience setting up high availability, configuring resource allocation, setting up capacity schedulers and configuring data level ACLs using Ranger, Sentry etc 
Experience working with and supporting middle layer technologies including web servers (httpd, ningx), application servers (Jboss, Tomcat) and database systems (postgres, mysql) 
Experience setting up enterprise security solution including setting up active directories, firewalls, SSL certificates, Kerberos KDC servers, etc 
Experience supporting on-premise solutions as well as on cloud - AWS and Azure. 
Experience working with containerized infrastructure and orchestration

Strong desire to work with start-ups 
Must be a team player 

Job Perks 

Attractive variable compensation package 
Flexible working hours - everything is results-oriented 
Opportunity to work with an award-winning organization in the hottest space in tech - artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning

  The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising.
 


 Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
 


   Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?
 


 Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.
 


   ABOUT THE ROLE:
 



     Senior Lead Software Engineers serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be optimizing your own code, as well as making sure that your reports are able to optimize theirs.
   


     You are an end-to-end owner. You will participate actively in all aspects of product strategy – from designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
   


     We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to lead engineers that focus on building large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
   


     Senior Lead Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct management of local teams, you will make others better and raise the bar for those around you.
   



   WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
 



     You have a sustained track record of leading engineers with a wide range of experience, while also making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you & your team are doing.
   


     You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.
   


     You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
   


     You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
   


     You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
   


     You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
   


     You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
   


     You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
   



   We also hope you'll take some time to learn more about The Trade Desk and what it's like to work here. Here are a few links to help get you started:
 



     Learn more about our mission to 
    
     transform the global advertising industry
    



     See 
    
     what it's like to be an engineer

     Experience a taste of 
    
     our global culture
    



     Get to know 
    
     a few members of our team
    





WHAT WE CARE ABOUT:
 

 What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly, efficiently manage your project goals, contribute to product strategy, and help develop your team as they solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
 

   Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
 


   Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership.

About the Role: 

Our Senior Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients. 
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. 
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. 
You are a broadly skilled engineer , accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers. 
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. 
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. 
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. 
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
