ABOUT VIDA 


What are we trying to solve? 
We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now. 
Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered. 
Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change. 
At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone. 


Why are we solving this problem? 
The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change. 


Who are we? 
We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns. 


Other things that we care about: 

Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. 
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village. 
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner. 
We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other

ABOUT VIDA 


What are we trying to solve? 
We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now. 
Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered. 
Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change. 
At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone. 


Why are we solving this problem? 
The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change. 


Who are we? 
We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns. 


Other things that we care about: 

Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. 
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village. 
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner. 
We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other

The Analytics team mission is to use data and experimentation to advance product innovation. We love building hacky products to test and iterate what’s best for our customers.

We are looking for junior and experienced data scientists to build a center of data excellence for Product & Experimentation in a diverse range of tech families. Your role is to guide a data-first approach to product thinking, design controlled experiments and be objective while evaluating results, all of this while working with stakeholders to evaluate new and innovative product and business ideas! You will help developers, designers & product managers across the company with recommendations on how to learn from unexpected results, study underlying causes for them and iterate on the next set of products to build for our users. 

What Will You Do? 
You will be working closely with various teams within a business line (Product, Business, Engineering, Design and Data Science) to understand data requirements, identify and track key metrics, and provide data-driven insights. You will also work with stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of new business/product ideas and provide appropriate recommendations. 

A Day In The Life

COVID-19 Considerations 
We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice. 

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard. 

Corporate Security Responsibility  All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must: 

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices; 
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed; 
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and 
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

What the role is



    The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies. Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Start Small and Move Fast - We build things quickly. If it works, good — how can we scale this up further? If not, what went wrong and what can we do better next time? Ownership - You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it. Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages are not just encouraged but essential.

What the role is



    The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies. Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering. Who we are GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.
  


 What you will be working on



    As a Software Engineer (frontend), you will: • Work closely with product managers, UX designers, data scientists and engineers to define and develop web applications • Use the latest web technologies to translate product specifications into fully functional interfaces • Develop and manage well-functioning APIs • Build and maintain extensible front-end code • Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities • Propose how to structure front end work • Have good eye for technical details in bridging the graphical design and technical feasibility • Be sensitive to the impact of front-end implementation to the users • Write production quality code, and • Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team. Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to: • Establish best practices • Share your expertise and mentor other engineers • Help with recruiting. You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it. Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value. What it is like working here We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. • Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily. • Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability. • Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good. • Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential. 
  


 What we are looking for



    We look for people who: • Have a demonstrated ability to build software • Have excellent understanding of web development and experience working with HTML5, CSS3, Node.js and modern JS frameworks (React.JS, Vue.JS, Redux etc.) • Have experience with RESTful APIs, web services, microservices • Good to have some experience in database, e.g. Postgres, MongoDB (for API development) • Cloud, container/docker & CI/CD experience will be a plus • Can write code to solve abstract problems • Can talk and reason about code with other engineers • Have an interest in data science and machine learning • Take the initiative to make things happen • Want to work for the public good We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company as we believe that diversity is meaningful to innovation.

We trust that you will get the job done wherever you are, and whatever works best for you – so work from home or take a break to exercise if you need to*. We also believe it’s important for you to keep honing your craft in the constantly-evolving tech landscape, so we provide and support a plethora of in-house and external learning and development opportunities all year round. *Subject to the nature of your job role that might require you to be onsite during fixed hours

Who we are GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.
  


 What you will be working on



    Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations. As a senior data scientist, you will: • Provide technical leadership to data scientists by coaching and mentoring through end-to-end data science product development and promote team engagement and motivation. • Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data • Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products • Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation • Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team • Establish best practices and build up data science capabilities in AI Platforms. • Help with recruiting. You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it. What it is like working here We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. • Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily. • Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability. • Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good. • Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.
