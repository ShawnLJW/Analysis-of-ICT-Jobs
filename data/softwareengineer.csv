The Software Practice
 The Software Practice is a Singapore based technology development firm that builds software for clients and its own business. Our core strength is in developing large and complex web and mobile applications by architecting and implementing robust, scalable and performant software.
 We started our firm working with entrepreneurs who brought expertise in specific industry verticals but required a technical team that could help them realise their product ideas. We partnered with them as their product teams helping them build their MVP, talk to customers and refine the product, raise money, and even hire their in-house tech teams while remaining as consultants.
 Now, our work spans across both public and private sectors where we've done several CTO-for-hire and product-team-for-hire gigs for entrepreneurs and enterprises looking to move fast. Our clients range from small start-ups looking to build and launch their product from scratch, to large enterprises (e.g. Government Agencies in Singapore such as DSTA, NEA, A*STAR and PUB) requiring innovative solutions in critical business workflows. Our enterprise clientele includes some of the largest SE Asian banks, Fortune 500 IT firms and one of Asia’s largest airports.
 Our culture is results-driven that values execution and creativity. You'll get a lot of ownership over your deliverables, and we trust you to ship high quality products on time. You will be part of a high performing cross functional team where you get to witness the direct impact of your work - seeing applications go live and seeing real-world usage.

 Openings

 Front-end (Javascript) developers
 Web developers
 Mobile developers (Kotlin and Swift)


 Requirements

 Solid programming ability in at least one language
 Clear and precise written communication. A large part of our team works remotely and it's vital that you are able to document ideas, progress and problems with clarity so everyone can work asynchronously.
 You must be happy to work independently (remote welcome) and be able to structure timelines, take ownership and responsibility and communicate clearly.
 We're looking for people with under 6 years’ experience - fresh graduates welcome too.
 Proficiency in written and spoken English is a must.

 Any experience in the one or more of the following is a definite plus:

 Worked on non-trivial Javascript applications
 Built large projects in VueJS/ReactJS/Svelte/Angular
 Web design experience - HTML/CSS
 Experience with AWS, Azure, Heroku or any other cloud platforms
 Development in C# or Python

 Please highlight if you have Native mobile application development (Kotlin and Swift)

 If you've built something in the past, do let us know. Github and/or StackOverflow profiles are welcome.
 You'll get to work in a fast-paced environment, with a great team of full-stack engineers who have a lot of experience in building large software applications from scratch.

 Be meticulous, but not perfectionist
 Be excited about developing software that people use
 Training will be provided, but if you know anything about no-code, that would be a bonus

 What is no-code development?
 No-code development platform (NCDPs) allow programmers and non-programmers to create application software through graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional computer programming. No-code development platforms are closely related to low-code development platforms as both are designed to expedite the application development process.
 Why do we require a degree in Computer Science or related fields for no-code development?
 Not everyone can be successful in no-code development. It still takes a programmer's mindset to be able to apply coding principles in the no-code space. No-code simply speeds up development, but you still need to think like a programmer.

Business leaders don’t really know how they will get there. And the very first step, of getting emissions measurement right, is hard.

     What happens when the world’s most innovative engineers collaborate with the world’s most creative storytellers? TV gets reinvented. Meet the reinventors: The Apple TV Services teams created and manage the Apple TV app as well as tvOS, which redefined and refined the way people watch their favorite shows, movies, and so much more — including everything they love from the major subscription services. Today, these teams also manage one of the most exciting new realms at Apple: They bring viewers the critically acclaimed and award-winning Apple Originals in Apple TV+. And they’ve engineered it so Apple TV+ can be enjoyed not only on Apple devices, but also directly on many new televisions and third-party streaming devices. To deliver Apple-level quality on a global scale, these engineers employ talent and tools to smoothly ingest and process a wide array of media assets. They work cross-functionally to handle video flow from content ingestion, playback, transcoding, and virtually everything else it takes to make the experience as seamless as possible. Join them to see what else is possible. Areas of work include macOS/iOS Engineering, Full-Stack Engineering, Front-End Engineering, Back-End Engineering, Quality Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, Data Science, Data Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering, Commerce Engineering, and Engineering Project Management.

https://sg.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=0d2a87447d8b6e7e&fccid=366382f52796fce2&vjs=3,Mobile Automation Test Engineer (Open to All Levels),"




We own and develop the Dyson Link Smart home app, which is at the forefront of Dyson's IoT experience. We are proud of what we have built so far; we have an App Store and Google Play rating of 4.5 and 4.3 stars respectively, we have more than 1 million active users worldwide and our IoT platform has over 3 million connected Dyson machines. We have huge ambition to grow this platform and as we connect more machines from more categories the challenge is significant.


 Our team 
There are 5 app teams, located in the UK and Singapore, each with up to 6 mobile developers and 3 test automation engineers, plus a scrum master and product owner. We all come from a variety of educational backgrounds and experience levels; not all of us are computer science graduates. We believe that teams composed of people from diverse backgrounds are more successful and innovative.  Our teams have the autonomy to manage their own work using Scrum or Kanban frameworks, each honing their ways of working through regular retrospectives and knowledge sharing. We all share a commitment to creating high-quality code, and engineers choose to follow practices such as pair programming, mobbing, and test-driven development. We also regularly share our knowledge and interests peer-to-peer through ‘community meetings’, which have led to the adoption of new technologies and improved cross-team collaboration.  We often need to interact with people from different parts of the business, such as embedded software and the cloud teams, so we plan in 5-sprint ‘increments’, based on the best bits of the Scaled Agile Framework. This gives us more visibility of upcoming work while remaining responsive, and allows us to collaborate effectively with other teams within our 11,000-person organisation.  Mutual trust and respect between team members is important to build a supportive environment where people can do their best work. Our teams understand themselves well enough to make decisions about how they work; everyone’s contribution is vital.  Besides being software professionals, we are also people who enjoy playing online or board games, heading out to lunchtime yoga classes, recording our latest run on Strava or just catching up over coffee. The last year has been a challenge, but we have maintained and strengthened our culture while working through the various lockdowns with virtual events, an informal team newsletter and an empathetic attitude to the needs of individuals.


 Our tech 
Android: We write our unit tests with JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito, and our UI tests are written in Kotlin using the Espresso framework with Kakao.  iOS: Unit tests are written with XCTest and RxTest, and we write our automated UI tests in Swift using XCUITest.  We also have a handful of cross platform appium tests written in ruby, but we are migrating away from these in favour of XCUITest and Espresso.  Unit and UI tests are written as part of each story to ensure we maintain an up to date and comprehensive set of automated tests with no test debt. We complement our automated tests with exploratory testing, involving both developers and testers in order to uncover issues quickly.


 About the role
 We are on the lookout for Test Engineers to join our mobile app team at Dyson. Communication, collaboration, self-evaluation and a desire to improve are second nature to you, and you value good engineering practises. You understand the need to deliver robust, testable code balanced against the need to deliver fast.

 Working with your fellow engineers to contribute to features and improvements to our Dyson Link app, ensuring they are tested, robust and scalable
 Working with colleagues from other disciplines, including developers, product owners, Scrum Masters, UX/UI designers, and software engineers in our cloud and embedded teams
 Sharing knowledge within the app team to develop your skills and competencies and those of your teammates
 Identifying new technologies, tools and approaches to help continually improve standards and quality
 Writing UI automation tests
 Coordinating exploratory testing sessions
 Monitoring and prioritising bugs
 Keeping the scrum team focused on a quality first mindset



 About you

 You’re interested in how technology can improve the environments people live in
 You’re a collaborative person that believes in the Agile principles and how they can help empowered teams deliver the best software
 You’ve contributed quality UI test code to commercial projects
 You’re passionate about learning new things and sharing those things with others
 You embrace change and can be flexible in your approach to problems
 Adept at understanding and explaining complex logical and technical details in both written and spoken English

As part of the Chat & Messaging product office in Singapore, you and the team would be focused on empowering our customers to provide a best-in-class messaging experience for their users. You would be involved in delivering a revamped customer messaging experience that will eventually culminate in the realisation of an omni-channel customer engagement product.
 You will be working with a group of young and dynamic engineers on developing a highly-response web-based application. You will learn about a well-structured web frontend architecture and the backend services to support it. You will work closely with the product team and UX designers to improve the current workflows or implement exciting new features.
 SSoftware Engineers at Zendesk are expected to be hands-on technologists who could contribute to application development directly, contribute to the design and implementation of projects, and be involved in technical discussions beyond their teams.

You should have previous experience with web infrastructure, distributed systems, or component-oriented software engineering.

 You'll be helping us build modern and impressive experiences on our Agent Workspace product.
 We're looking for engineers who are not afraid of touching every layer of our technical stack. The teams working on each feature are small and working in bi-weekly sprints to meet achievable deliverables, so there is a lot of meaningful collaboration.
 Collaborate closely with the Product Manager, the Team Lead and the Designer to provide technical insights and early estimates on the assigned project.
 Take the lead on technical design discussions and propose innovative solutions.
 Ensure scalability, performance, maintainability and security of the technical platform in collaboration with the ops teams.
 Actively participate in full-stack coding, reviewing pull requests and testing.
 Use your experience to mentor junior members in the team and evangelize coding best practices through pairing sessions, and code reviews.
 Become a key contributor to better working practices across Zendesk.


 Job qualifications and requirements

 You’re tenacious, driven, and have a passion for learning. You love to collaborate and have meaningful interactions with everyone you meet. You believe that online real-time communication fosters trust, and delivers valuable benefits to customer engagement. You want to create code to make these experiences even better.

   You will be successful in this role if you:
 

 Have a proven record in Software Engineering with strong capabilities in any of the major web-programming languages (Java, Python, Ruby or Go).
 Possess a working level knowledge of Javascript and experience with NodeJS and React.
 Have a strong understanding of Web technologies and the interactions between the frontend client (e.g. web browsers) and the backend stack.
 Are experienced in building scalable, distributed systems (exposure to Kafka, GraphQL and gRPC is a plus).
 Have strong troubleshooting skills by tracking metrics, logs and traces across disparate services.
 Have a good command over usage of data structures and algorithms
 Have excellent written and verbal communication skills, put the customer first and respect your commitment to deliver.
 Personal projects, collaboration with the open-source community or active learning initiatives would be a good sign of your passion to learn and solve problems.


 Culture and Perks

 We nearly 200 engineers in our Singapore office which is home to our highly successful Chat product. You can find us at Marina One West Tower. We approach work with calm, focus, a sense of humour whilst keeping sane working hours. At Zendesk, we also have a culture where ideas come from the bottom up - we have yearly company hackathons!
 Perks include stock options, flexible working, $1500 training allowance, medical cover, mobile phone allowance and 4 months parental leave. These are always subject to change and usually in the positive!
